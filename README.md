# horiseon-refactor

## Description

I changed the non semantic elements to semantic ones. Replacing div with Header, main, nav, section, article, and footer. Added alt attributes to icon and image elements. Made sure to added title to html and made sure headings fell in sequential order.

In CSS style sheet grouped together the atrributes that had same class and selectors to clean up the css style sheet style. Also changed the div attributes to nav that was originally in the CSS
